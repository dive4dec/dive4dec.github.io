# DIVE for DEC

## Objective

For **D**iscovery-**E**nriched **C**urriculum, create a virtual learning environment that is

- **D**iversified: allowing students of different backgrounds to explore easily and freely in different ways;
- **I**nteractive: providing helpful guidance and feedback while students explore;
- **V**ersatile: applicable to a variety of courses so students may reuse the same tools to learn different subjects; and
- **E**ngaging: sparking students' interest and helping them excel in the subject beyond what is taught in class.

## Things to Try

- Our [homepage](https://dive4dec.github.io) powered by [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite), which can run notebooks without a server directly in modern browsers such as Firefox 90+ and Chromium 89+.

- DIVE Widgets:
  - [Demo notebook](https://dive4dec.github.io/lab?path=main.ipynb)

- DIVE into Math notebooks:
  - [Pythagorean Theorem](https://dive4dec.github.io/lab?path=pythagorean.ipynb)
